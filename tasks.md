# Project Tasks

1. [ ] **Add Request ID**: Add request ID to the request context and ensure it is included in all log entries for tracing. Also enable coloring of logs based on log level. only color the log level.
2. [ ] **Source Node Encoding**: Ensure the trip origin/destination/any implicit nodes are explicitly encoded as a node in the itinerary graph, not just implied by the first edge.
3. [ ] **Multiple Itineraries**: Enable full implementation and handling of multiple itinerary options generated by the Planner.
4. [ ] **Sort & Categorize Options**: Implement logic to sort flight and hotel options (e.g., by price, duration) and categorize them (e.g., "Cheapest", "Fastest", "Best Value"). Enable mechanisms for users to specify custom sorting preferences for the results.
5. [ ] **Day Activities Subgraph**: Implement the subgraph structure to detail day-to-day activities (POIs, restaurants) within specific location nodes.
